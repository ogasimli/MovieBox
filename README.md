# Movie Box
A highly functional and interactive android app developed by me for first and second stages of Android Nanodegree Program.

Movie Box was evaluated and graded as "" by certified Udacity code reviewer.

## Features

The main features of the app:
* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
* Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews

## The Movie Database API

Movie Box uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
In order to be able to launch the app you have to get a valid API key from The Movie Database and add the following line to your gradle.properties file:

TheMovieDBAPIKey=YOUR_API_KEY

After that just replace YOUR_API_KEY with your valid TMDB api key.
